    Originally drawn to the world of visual propaganda, Eitan Gutenmacher now navigates the intricate interplay between artist, designer, and creative director. 
    In Yeshiva, Eitan began seeing himself in the stories of the Talmud at a young age—slowly realizing a hieroglyphic visual language within the safe realm of Photoshop canvases. 

    Sourcing inspiration in what Heschel termed “deep theology,” Gutenmacher meditates between internet threads, printed advertisements, and loose midrashic tales into new visual indulgences. 
    Desire, above all else, informs every selection, nudge, and paste in his work. 

    Outside of establishing Havurah and Verklempt! Magazine, Eitan’s clients have included Hillel International, Via Maris, The Free Press, and Zusha.
